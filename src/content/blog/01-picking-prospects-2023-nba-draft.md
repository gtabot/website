Earlier this January, I found myself in the extremely lucky and fortunate position to be working as a Machine Learning Consultant/Analyst for a professional sports team, my favorite team of all of sports, the [Washington Wizards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Wizards). At the moment, I am still working with them and am under an NDA contract so I can't speak much about that work specifically.

However, while working with the team, I became very familiar with the 2023 draft prospects. Typically, in past NBA drafts, I might only know the top 2 or 3 prospects and then perhaps the few or so that the Wizards were commonly mocked to pick. This year I got to be very familiar with about 70 or so and the intricacies of their game. When it came time to actually watch the draft, I decided to get in the mindset of each of the teams and play GM for all 58 picks.

The following picks are my own, personal opinion and <strong><u>are not representative of any contributions I've made with the Wizards</u></strong>. I plan to complete the same exercise over the upcoming years and evaluate my personal picks against each team's actual selection. Here they are:

Taking a moment to assess my lottery results, I was in sync with 6 out of the 14 picks. Whether or not that's a good or bad thing we'll have to wait a few years to find out, but for now I'll interpret that stat as I'm a sane, logical drafter (so far...)

For the most part, my personal pick was of the same position of the actual pick... except for the team I work for and root for, the Washington Wizards... I wonder what that means...

I also want to note that I have not selected Cam Whitmore as any of my personal picks in the lottery. And despite his very high mock draft and online big board rankings, I found it very validating that the other lottery teams agreed with me in not selecting him.

Rounding out the first round, I was only in sync with the team GMs in one selection, Cam Whitmore to the Houston Rockets at pick #20.

Going into the second round, beauty is more in the eye of the beholder and team strategy starts to come more into play. I don't expect to match many more picks, however I'm continuing to make selections to see if the players who I would have picked would've fared better than the ones that were.

Turns out I was in sync with two selections. The Wizards selection of Tristan Vukcevic at pick #42 and FINALLY Trayce Jackson-Davis got selected with the second to last pick #57 to the Golden State Warriors. I see that as mathematically the steal of the draft as I think he'll be able to produce valuably as a role-player off the bench in his first few seasons.

At the conclusion of the draft there were only three players I would've selected that did not get selected. Those players are the following:

- [Colin Castleton](https://www.tankathos.com/players/colin-castleton) (C)
- [Adam Flagler](https://www.tankathos.com/players/adam-flagler) (PG)
- D'Moi Hodge (SG)

This was definitely a fun exercise and I can't wait until next year where I get to both do it again, and evaluate my results after a season.
