# Picking Prospects for the 2023 NBA Draft

Earlier this January, I found myself in the extremely lucky and fortunate position to be working as a Machine Learning Consultant/Analyst for a professional sports team, my favorite team in all of sports, the [Washington Wizards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Wizards). At the moment, I am still working with them and am under an NDA contract so I can't speak much about that work specifically, at the moment.

However, while working with the team, I became very familiar with the 2023 draft prospects. Typically, in past drafts, I might only know the top 2 or 3 prospects and then perhaps the few or so that the Wizards were commonly mocked to pick. This year I got to be very familiar with about 70 or so and the intricacies of their game. When it came time to actually watch the draft, I decided to get in the mindset of each of the teams and play GM for all 58 picks.

The following picks are my own, personal opinion and are not representative of any contributions I've made with the Wizards. I plan to complete the same exercise over the upcoming years and evaluate my personal picks against each team's actual selection. Here they are:

Taking a moment to assess my lottery results, I was in sync with 6 out of the 14 picks. Whether or not that's a good or bad thing we'll have to wait a few years to find out, but for now I'll interpret that stat as I'm a sane, logical drafter (so far...)

For the most part, my personal pick was of the same position of the actual pick... except for the team I work for and root for, the Washington Wizards... I wonder what that means...

I also want to note that I have not selected Cam Whitmore as any of my personal picks in the lottery. And despite his very high mock draft and online big board rankings, I found it very validating that the other lottery teams agreed with me in not selecting him.

Rounding out the first round, I was only in sync with the team GMs with one selection, Cam Whitmore to the Houston Rockets at pick #20.

Going into the second round, beauty is more in the eye of the beholder and team strategy starts to come more into play. I don't expect to match many more picks, however I'm continuing to make selections to see if the players who I would have picked would've fared better than the ones that were.

## Second Round

Turns out I was in sync with two selections. The Wizards selection of Tristan Vukcevic at pick #42 and FINALLY Trayce Jackson-Davis got selected with the second to last pick #57 to the Golden State Warriors. I see that as mathematically the steal of the draft as I think he'll be able to produce valuably as a role-player off the bench in his first few seasons.

At the conclusion of the draft there were only three players I would've selected that did not get selected. Those players are the following:
* [Colin Castleton](https://www.tankathos.com/players/colin-castleton) (C)
* [Adam Flagler](https://www.tankathos.com/players/adam-flagler) (PG)
* D'Moi Hodge (SG)

This was definitely a fun exercise and I can't wait until next year where I get to both do it again, and evaluate my results after a season.
